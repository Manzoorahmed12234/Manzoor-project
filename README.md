Title: Statistics in Data Science Final Project - Boston Housing Data Analysis
Description: This project is a Python implementation of a statistical analysis of the Boston housing dataset. The project addresses the following questions:

Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not?
Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?
Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?
What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner-occupied homes?

I recently developed a Python implementation of a statistical analysis of the Boston housing dataset. The project addresses a variety of questions related to housing prices, including the impact of proximity to the Charles River, the proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940, the relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town, and the impact of distance to employment centers on median home value. The project uses a variety of statistical methods, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and visualization, to answer these questions.
